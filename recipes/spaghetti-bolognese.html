        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. 
                Cook the spaghetti in the boiling water until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. 
                Cook the bacon in the oil until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Stir the onion, celery, carrot, and oregano into the bacon; continue cooking until the vegetables begin to soften, another 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
                Crumble the ground beef into the vegetable mixture; cook and stir until the beef is completely cooked and no longer pink, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour the balsamic vinegar over the ground beef mixture; allow to simmer until the liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. 
                Stir the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar into the ground beef mixture; 
                bring the mixture to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, and remove from heat. Stir the fresh basil into the mixture.</li>
