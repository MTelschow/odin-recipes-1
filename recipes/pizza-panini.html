                Everyone loves pizza and everyone loves sandwiches so why not mix the both? 
                This is the only dish that I've never had but I am certainly planning on making this in the near future! 
                Another dish that has originated from Italy (thank the higher powers for the Italians), 
                this takes two traditional Italian dishes and puts them together in a delightful mish-mash.

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat; 
                add mushrooms and saute until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from heat to cool.</li>
            <li> Preheat a panini press according to manufacturer's instructions.</li>
            <li> Spread an even layer of tomato sauce onto the cut sides of each ciabatta roll. 
                Sprinkle equal amounts of garlic and oregano onto each roll. Place 2 salami slices side by side onto each roll; 
                top each with 2 slices ham. Divide red onion, mushrooms, red pepper, olives, and basil between the 4 sandwiches and spread evenly atop the meats. 
                Finish by topping with provolone cheese and sandwiching roll halves around the fillings.</li>
            <li> Cook sandwiches on preheated panini press until there are dark brown grill marks on the bread, 
                the cheese is melted, and the center is warm, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
